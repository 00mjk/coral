Installation
============

For most people, installing Coral will be as simple as

   pip install numpy
   pip install coral

Windows users may need to install vcpython2.7 first http://aka.ms/vcpython27

For more detailed instructions as well as what optional packages can be
installed (such as those required to do structural analysis), see
