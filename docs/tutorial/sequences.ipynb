Most design functions in `coral` return a `coral.DNA` object or something that contains a `coral.DNA` object (like `coral.Primer`). In addition, there are related `coral.RNA` and `coral.Peptide` objects for representing RNA and peptide sequences and methods for converting between them.\n",

    "An extremely important method is the `.copy()` method. It may seem redundant to have an entire function for copying a sequence - why not just assign a `sequence.DNA` object to a new variable? As in most high-level languages, python does not actually copy entire objects in memory when assignment happens - it just adds another reference to the same data. The short of it is that the very common operation of generating a lot of new variants to a sequence, or copying a sequence, requires the use of a `.copy()` method. For example, if you want to generate a new list of variants where an 'a' is substituted one at a time at each part of the sequence, using `.copy()` returns the correct result (the first example) while directly accessing example_dna has horrible consequences (the edits build up, as they all modify the same piece of data sequentially):"
